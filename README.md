# Coding-Challenges

This repo is meant for short and creative coding projects. 

It is quite often that I come accross interesting topics on the internet (whether it is a video on YouTube, a post on Facebook, or just something that pops up in my mind). Sometimes I keep thinking about these things, trying to figure something out about it or how it would be interesting to implement it and look at it. Doing so results in short (usually about an afternoon) and often creative (especially with visualising stuff) coding projects. 

The idea of this short projects is based on a [videos serie](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) by [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/).
